## 📖 About

I created this project simply because I needed a very simple ticket system that met my needs (single developer). It supports multiple admins, but I didn't add features like ticket assignment, as I'm the only user! All tickets needing a response are in a single queue for all admins to see and manage. As it's only me, I never added the ability to assign tickets. Maybe that can be a future enhancement.

## 📋 Requirements

- **PHP** >= 8.2
- **Composer**
- **Node.js** >= 22
- **NPM**
- **SQLite**, **MySQL**, or **PostgreSQL**

Optional, for the containerised deployment only:

- **Docker** with the Compose plugin — see [Deployment](#-deployment)

---

## 🚀 Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/johneady/support-manager.git
cd support-manager
```

### 2️⃣ Install and setup

Run the composer setup command which handles dependency installation, environment configuration, database migration, and frontend asset building:

```bash
composer setup
```

> 💡 **Tip:** Optionally seed the database with sample data. For development, this simplifies the login flow by creating an admin user with simple credentials. This project leverages the [spatie/laravel-login-link](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-login-link) package to streamline development logins via one-click authentication links.

```bash
php artisan db:seed
```

> ⚠️ **Security Warning:** Never run the seeder in production, as this creates a significant security vulnerability with predictable credentials.

### 3️⃣ Start the application

For development with all services (server, queue worker, log viewer, and Vite):

```bash
composer run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

## ⚙️ Configuration

### 📧 Mail Configuration

Configure your mail driver in `.env` to enable email notifications:

```env
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=your-smtp-host
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=your-username
MAIL_PASSWORD=your-password
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS="support@example.com"
MAIL_FROM_NAME="Support Manager"
```

### 👑 Admin Users

To create an admin user, register a new account and then promote it via Tinker:

```bash
php artisan tinker
>>> User::where('email', 'admin@example.com')->update(['is_admin' => true]);
```

---

## 💡 Developer Tips

### 📧 Previewing Emails

Use the `mail:preview` command to preview and send test emails during development. This command creates test data on-the-fly without saving to your database and sends emails immediately.

```bash
# Interactive mode - prompts for email and email type
php artisan mail:preview

# Send a specific email type
php artisan mail:preview password-reset
php artisan mail:preview new-ticket
php artisan mail:preview ticket-reply-to-customer

# Send to a specific email address
php artisan mail:preview --to=you@example.com new-ticket

# Send all email types at once
php artisan mail:preview --all
php artisan mail:preview --to=you@example.com --all
```

**Available Email Types:**

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `password-reset` | Password reset link (ResetPassword) |
| `email-verification` | Email verification link (VerifyEmail) |
| `new-ticket` | Admin notification for new support tickets |
| `ticket-reply-to-customer` | Reply notification to customer |
| `ticket-reply-to-admin` | Admin notification for customer replies |
| `ticket-auto-closed` | Ticket auto-closed notification |
| `user-invitation` | User invitation email |

The command uses Laravel Prompts for an interactive selection menu when run without arguments. All test data (users, tickets, replies) is created in-memory using model factories, so no database records are created.

---

## 🧪 Testing

This project uses [Pest](https://pestphp.com) for testing.

```bash
# Run all tests
php artisan test

# Run tests with compact output
php artisan test --compact

# Run a specific test file
php artisan test --filter=TicketTest

# Run tests in parallel
vendor/bin/pest --parallel

# Run linting + tests
composer test
```

---

## 🎨 Code Style

This project follows the [Laravel coding style](https://laravel.com/docs/contributions#coding-style) enforced by [Laravel Pint](https://laravel.com/docs/pint).

```bash
# Fix code style
vendor/bin/pint

# Check code style without fixing
vendor/bin/pint --test
```

## 🚢 Deployment

Two deployment paths are supported.

### 🐳 Docker (Dokploy)

The container image runs nginx and php-fpm under supervisor, with a second
container for the scheduler. Deploy `docker-compose.dokploy.yml` — never
`docker-compose.yml`, which is the local stack and embeds a throwaway database
password and app key.

Set these in Dokploy's environment settings before the first deploy; a missing
one fails the deploy with a named error rather than booting on a silent default:

| Variable | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `APP_KEY` | At cutover, reuse the existing key — see the warning below |
| `APP_URL` | The `https://` domain Traefik serves |
| `DB_HOST`, `DB_DATABASE`, `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD` | The Dokploy-managed database |
| `MAIL_MAILER`, `MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` | `smtp` in production; `log` silently delivers nothing |
| `ALERTS_TO_ADDRESS` | Where failing health checks are sent |
| `TRUST_PROXIES` | `*` behind Traefik, so HTTPS is detected and HSTS is sent |

> ⚠️ **Migrating an existing site:** carry the **current** `APP_KEY` across
> rather than generating a new one. Sessions are encrypted
> (`SESSION_ENCRYPT=true`), so a different key signs every user out.

Point the Domains tab at port **80** on the `app` service; Dokploy injects the
Traefik labels and requests the certificate.

To verify the image locally before deploying:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.docker up --build -d
open http://localhost:8080
docker compose --env-file .env.docker down -v
```

Always pass `--env-file .env.docker`. Compose's default variable file is the
project-root `.env` — this application's own Laravel config — and reading it
would configure the containers from your development settings.
